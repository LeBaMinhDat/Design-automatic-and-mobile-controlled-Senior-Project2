# Design-a-system-of-watering-the-plants-by-mobile
## Overview
* The strong development of current technology, especially the appearance of Arduino has helped open up a new path for microcontrollers. The advent of Arduino has helped people develop in programming and designing electronic components, especially helping those who are just starting to learn about microcontrollers but do not have much background knowledge. The hardware of the device is integrated with many open source code in C language and many libraries in Arduino. So Arduino is more and more popular in hardware design in the world
* Intelligent and automation technologies have been used extensively in recent years. Particularly with the " Automatic Home" initiative, which completely incorporates the expanding requirements of the personal sphere. Today, there are a lot of businesses in Vietnam that stand out for offering and creating "Smart Home" systems, such as the BKAV firm, which enables owners to actively monitor and control their homes swiftly and automatically. Our family's everyday rituals, such as turning on the light, the fan, or the curtain when it rains, watering the plants, or watching the kids, are monotonous.
* Due to the aforementioned, my group decided to perform the "Automatic Home" research project to learn more about how to operate and connect wirelessly and to also address important family issues.
